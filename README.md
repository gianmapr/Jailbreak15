# Jailbreak15
A jailbreak tool for iOS 15.

This tool is a "shortcut-based" jailbreak. At this point it is useless beacuse need a kernel exploit.
It can be called as a "simulation" of a possible jailbreak. To run it you need to enable the untrusted shortcuts execution function on settings app and enable the access at the notifications for the shortcut before run the script.

**ATTENTION:** if you add the shortcut on the homescreen, the script wont work. Always run it from shortcut app.
